# The unofficial guide to monitoring with Equinix Metal

This guide is meant to convey a high level understanding of monitoring and ovserseability with the Equinix Metal platform and Bare Metal instances themselves. It should not be considered "official" documentation in it's current state, and any specific implementation paths detailed here should not be considered "supported" by the Equinix Metal support structure itself, everything here should be considered "BYOS" or Bring Your Own Support.
