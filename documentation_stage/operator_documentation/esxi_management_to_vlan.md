## Moving the ESXi Management IP to a Metal Layer-2 VLAN Interface

**Disclaimer**: This document is **NOT** an official document, and is not supported by Equinix Metal. It is here for reference / convenience.

When Equinix Metal instances are deployed with ESXi, by default the ESXi "management" interface, as in the IP address that is used to bind the management services (console, SSH etc), is assigned to the Equinix Metal provided Layer-3 IP addresses (by default Public IP, if not Public then Management).

The following steps allow an operator to move that management interface to a Metal VLAN interface.

This guide makes the following assumptions where you can make changes or substitutions as relevant for your deployment.

* Layer-3 Networks:
	* Metal Public: `147.28.150.96/29`
	* Metal Private: `10.68.93.184/29`
	* Operator Management Network: `172.16.10.15/24`
		* Where Operator has gateway in that network assigned to IP: `172.16.10.1/24`
* VLANS: Operator has two VLANs provisioned in Metal for the correct Metro. This guide assumes VLAN ID `1000` & `1001` where VLAN `1000` is the correct Layer-2 VLAN for the Operator Management Network `172.16.10.0/24`, and `1001` is here as the second VLAN that will be unconfigured on the host itself.
* SSH Keys: [That the customer has correctly configured SSH keys in the Equinix Metal platform](https://metal.equinix.com/developers/docs/accounts/ssh-keys/)

### Using Metal Gateways for network connectivity

This document does not address the use of [Metal's Gateway](https://metal.equinix.com/developers/docs/networking/metal-gateway/) feature as another vector for management access, though there may be very good reasons to do so. While the use of a Metal Gateway may be the preferred path, the reasons for / agaisnt fall outside the scope of this document and will not be addressed. For questions about the usage of Equinix Metal Gateway instances, please consult with your Equinix Metal sales and support team.

### Configuring the Equinix Metal instance in the Equinix Metal platform

#### Configuring the Metal Instance for Unbonded Layer-2 aware modes

[This section is convered by the Metal "Hybrid Unbonded" documentation visible here](https://metal.equinix.com/developers/docs/layer2-networking/hybrid-unbonded-mode/):

1) Find the newly provisioned ESXi instance and load it's details page
2) Under the "Network" details page where "Network" is visible on the lefthand side page selection bar:
	1) Click the blue "Convert to Other Network Type" button
	2) Select `Hybrid` or `Layer-2` depending on your design, this guide assumes Hybrid
	3) Select `Unbonded`, as we are working with a currently unlicensed ESXi instance, LACP is unavailable to us so the switch bond must be broken.
		* **If the reasoning behind breaking the bond / interaction with LACP is not understood, please reach out to your Equinix Metal sales and support team as this requires substantial contextual understanding**
	4) Click the "Convert to Hybrid Networking" button at the bottom of the side panel
	5) The Metal instances switch ports will now be converted to Hybrid Unbonded mode
3) Once complete, the blue "+ Add New Vlan" button should be visible in the lower right hand side
	1) Add your first VLAN to the `eth1` interface (this represent the second physical interface of the box, for `n2.xlarge.x86` instances this would likely be `eth3`)
	2) Add a second VLAN to the `eth1` interface. The reasoning for this is it enforces `802.1q` tagging all the way to the host.
4) Connect to the "Out-of-band console", [the details for which should be exposed by a clickable button at the top of the instances details page](https://metal.equinix.com/developers/docs/resilience-recovery/serial-over-ssh/)
	* It is strongly recommended to ensure your SSH / terminal client is sized for *at least* 80x pixels wide by 25x pixels tall. It may be useful for operator sanity to have your terminal be signifincalty larger than that.
5) Once connected to the console, you may need to press enter or other keystroke to be presented with the output from the VMWare mangement text interface:
