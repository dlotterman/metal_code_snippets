# How to protect a documentation git repository with Gitleaks

Documentation repositories, which go by many names and aliases, are a great tool for sharing information in a long-lived but unofficial way. The very nature of their purpose can make them vulnerable to operator error, if the intent if the repo is to document work such as `curl` based API commands, then sensitive API credentials are simply likely to leak into the repository. 

[Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) is a fantastic tool for this problem. While clearly purposed more for developer oriented workspaces, it's simplicity of [baseline management](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#creating-a-baseline) and ease of integration with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), mean that it can be easily configured to prevent credential leaks easily, before they are commited and then pushed, which is ideal for documentation repositories that may not be "GitOps" managed to include any Github or repository host side security protection.

Put simply, if a repository will store files containing fields like:

```
curl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' --header 'X-Auth-Token: 'YOURTOKENHERE'' 'https://api.equinix.com/metal/v1/projects/'YOURPROJECTIDHERE'/hardware-reservations'
```

Theres a good chance you copied that directly from a terminal and into a text editor that saved to a file in the repository. If you forgot to manually sanitize it, it's likely that credential will get commited and pushed to the public without review. No bueno.

Gitleaks will create a baseline of your repository when you know it is in a credential safe place. Before (hence `pre-hook`) every subsequent commit, Gitleaks will check the new changes against the safe baseline. If it can detect strings that look like they may be credentials that are being net new added or changed, it will abort the change before getting to the commit message stage and provide an error about what it saw:

```
$ git commit .

# Install Gitleaks CLI (Optional)

[Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#installing) documents a couple of different paths for installing itself.

If you are looking to just get expiramenting as quickly as possible, I suggest downloading the pre-compiled binary for your system at their [releases page](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/releases).

This isn't strictly needed, we will setup the git repository to install it's own Gitleaks environment. Installing Gitleaks through this path gives us an operator friendly view of the tool.

## Setting a baseline

[Read the documentation](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#creating-a-baseline) around setting a baseline.

Going through a and creating a baseline before working through Git `pre-commit` can be useful for working with existing Documentation repositories, that likely already have lots of hand-sanitized data.

To compare against baseline:

- `gitleaks detect -v -c gitleaks_em.toml --baseline-path gitleaks-report.json`

My baseline command looks like:

- `gitleaks detect -v -c gitleaks_em.toml --report-path gitleaks-report.json --baseline-path gitleaks-report.json`

### My commands:

To read a simple report:

- `gitleaks detect -c gitleaks_em.toml -v`

To avoid git history:

- `gitleaks detect -c gitleaks_em.toml --no-git -v`

To write the report as a file to use as a baseline (say you add a new file that is sanitized that goes into the baseline):

- `gitleaks detect -v -c gitleaks_em.toml --report-path gitleaks-report.json`

To commit overwriding gitleaks (I like to do my commit message in an edit versus the `-m` flag:

- `SKIP=gitleaks git commit .`

# Install pre-commit

You will need to install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install). Where I would normally say install things to a `venv` by default, the easiest and most likely path you want is to install `pre-commit` at the same level of abstraction as how you use git. Put another way, if you got `git` from `apt install git`, then just do `pip install pre-commit` (or possibly `pip3 install pre-commit`).

# Setup your repository:

## Gitleaks Pre-hook setup

Follow the Gitleaks documentation on installing a *pre-hook* file:
- [Here](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#pre-commit)

**Note**
While also contained in a file in this repository, my pre-hook file looks like this all said and done:
```
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks
    rev: v8.16.1
    hooks:
      - id: gitleaks
        args: ['-c', 'gitleaks_em.toml', '--baseline-path', 'gitleaks-report.json']
```		

### pre-hook build errors

If you attempt your first commit and get an error like:
```

You can be a responsible operator and really dig into it, or you can be lazy like me and find it's a ephemeral (likely) golang toolchain problem I don't really care about, so I can ignore it and re-run my commit with a `GOFLAG`:

- `GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false git commit .` 

And then never worry about it again.

# Gitleaks .toml file
The default [configuration toml file](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#configuration) is enough for most things, it should catch Metal and related tokens.

I've stared a WIP of some more explicit Metal toml [here](/gitleaks_em.toml). It has fairly aggressive checks on Equinix Metal related magic numbers, namely `32` character strings that look like API tokens, and UUID's. 

The aggressive checks are intended for these documentation heavy repositories. Where the aggressive checks are there to catch absent minded additions, with the expectation being that the operator updates the baseline

# .gitignore

I don't like the baseline file in my repo, so I exlude it from git in my [.gitignore](/.gitignore)
