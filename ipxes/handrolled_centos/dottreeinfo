; the .treeinfo file is needed by a variety of Annaconda (+CentOS) PXE (+iPXE)
; boot options that are well documented here:
; https://anaconda-installer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/boot-options.html
; in particular, the inst.stage2 needs to be thought out depending on how 
; custom / handrolled the installer is or if it's an appliance export
; from say a virutalization image manager

; this needs to be named `.treeinfo` (wihtout ticks) 
; and placed in a http exposed directory
; likely the same place hosting your ipxe file
; the `maininmage` in `[stage2]` is key
