# Angeline the Diligent Purchaser for Bisco Foods

Angeline is a recent addition for the [Bisco Foods](../orgs/bisco_foods.md) Vendor Management team, coming from an acquisition Bisco made of a regional supplier last year. She is respected, but known for being scrupilous, she has distinguished herself on the new team by assuming things should be the way they have been.


## Profesional Goals

Angeline never set out to be in Vendor relations, but a series of oppertunities and job evolutions put her in charge of sourcing for her small regional supplier before it's acquisition by Bisco. Eying a potential path to an executive desk at Bisco Foods, Angeline outperforms her teamates and even superiors both behind scenes and in front of vendors.

Angeline sees Digital Transformation as a path towards a radical evolution in the way Bisco Foods does back office systems, and is always on the lookout to replace a manual or one-off purchase with something that can be automated or potentially consumed in a as a Service way.

The IT teams have come to respect Angeline, seeing Angeline as a resource to help get things done in Bisco Foods bureaucracy.

## Personal Life

Angeline doesn't make much known about her personal life at work, instead preferring to stick to professional topics.

### Technical Toolbelt

Angeline is a believer in SaaS and on-demand consumption of services, having consolidated a variety of business processes and platforms onto a single Onspring + Tableu system that can ingest ETL reports from the companies SAP platform.


### Painpoints

While Angeline sets the bar at Bisco Foods for organization and professionalism, even she cannot keep up with the rate of M&A at Bisco Foods, and looks for any way to simplify the onboarding process for each M&A to Bisco Foods chosen vendor solutions.

### Thoughts on Cloud and Cloud Adoption

Angline is a empassioned convert to Cloud consumption models for Bisco Foods, which has traditionally been stuck in static, rigid and long term contracts with its infrastructure vendors.

Angeline is however technically limited, he powers are in Vendor management not Cloud wizardy. She can consume services that are ready to consume, but needs help from other teams to implement anything outside of their teams domain.


### Team

Angeline's team is small, with a roster of people who have primarily been there for decades, herself being the only new team member in the last 5 years, herself there via acquisition.

Angeline has a working professional relationship with her team, but her boss see's them as competition, and that relationship can be difficult.

Angeline has a champion with another executive, giving her some "over and up" escaltion capability when she needs it.
