# Rob The Enterprise Back Office Stitcher and Fixer for Bisco Foods Holding Corp

Rob is 22x year veteran of [Bisco Foods](../orgs/bisco_foods.md), and while they do not manage humans, Rob is a well regarded senior member of the Facilities Networking team, primarily responsible for stiching the networks of Bisco's various facilities and operations together into some kind of a useable thing.

## Professional Goals

Rob appears to avoid office politics and tries to stay out of business conversations, and will only engage on topics relevant to their immediate projects.

## Personal Life

Rob has a family, and when asked, will talk about their 2 kids, the youngest of which is starting high school, the eldest is in their second year of college.

Rob has said that he likes going to their family getaway cabin near the Ozarks with his wife and kids for vacation.

### Technical Toolbelt

Rob is a long time Cisco networking professional, and has held Cisco certifcations for over 20 years.

Rob can work a remote connectivity project from local-loop to software defined VPN configurations, but considers themselves servers and storage averse, preferring to let those teams speak for design decisions related to his projects in their subject domain.

### Rob's painpoints

Rob is perpetually behind on his project to decommision and replace legacy remote site VPN infrastructure. While he likes his new global DMVPN design, the rate at which legacy sites get added to his list outpaces his ability to source hardware and deliver it to each newly acquired site and connect it together.

Rob is also individually staffed and is senior on his team, he has no junior or team to delegate to, meaning Rob has to wear many hats and manage many fires.

### Rob's thoughts on Cloud and Cloud Adoption

Rob has few opinions on Cloud, choosing to focus his time and expertise on the systems he knows and works with daily. The CTO's Cloud Mandate has yet to arrive at Rob's desk.

Rob has yet to be shown or convinced that cloud can be relevant to his world of local loops and hardware SSL termination.


#### Rob's Team

Rob's team is a small but mighty group of hangers on, some of the few people left who understand the network after decades of M&A.

Rob and his team have been playing catchup on their project roadmap since 2007.

It is unclear who Rob reports to, but no one seems to report to Rob.
