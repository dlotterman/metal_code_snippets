# "No Code" + "Safe First" + "Bastion" + "Virtual Appliance Host" for Equinix Metal

Or **NCSFBVAHfEM** for short... Just kiding, shorten it to *no_code_bastion* or `ncb` for really short.

When evaluating or working with [Equinix Metal](https://deploy.equinix.com/product/bare-metal/), operators often want a "fastest path to running an application or device inside of the Equinix", where the bootstrap curve of the Equinix Metal is such that often the hardest part is figuring out where to start.

</p>

*no_code_bastion* aims to minimize the amount of toil needed to quickly and safely establish a familiar operational beachead inside of Equinix Metal for operators looking to get going quickly and safely-ish. It provides critical functions like:
- Secure inside <-> outside access to an Equinix Metal environment
- Network and utility services inside Equinix Metal
- Container and VM hosting inside Equinix Metal
- Operational tools and niceties

All thats needed to get an `ncb` instance is to Copy (`Ctrl / Cmd + C`) [this cloud-init](cloud_inits/el9_no_code_safety_first_appliance_host.yaml) and Paste (`Ctrl / Cmd + P`) the contents into the [Userdata form](https://deploy.equinix.com/developers/docs/metal/server-metadata/user-data/#usage) when provisioning an Equinix Metal instance with `alma_9` or `rocky_9`. Thats it.

***For best experience, use the `.mime` encoded file***

This minimzes browser / user input inconsistencies. Simply copy the [text from the mime encoded file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dlotterman/metal_code_snippets/main/virtual_appliance_host/no_code_with_guardrails/cloud_inits/el9_no_code_safety_first_appliance_host.mime) and paste it into the user data section of the Metal instance provisoning page.

The `mime` encoded file is simply the output of `cloud-init devel make-mime` run on the `yaml` file in the same directory.

## Support

Please note, as with anything in this reposistory, this resource is not supported by **ANYONE**. It is meant solely and exclusively as a reference resource. That being said, as of summer 2023, the owner is still looking to improve this resource and fix any quick wins. If anything about this perks you interest, get in contact with your [Equinix Metal sales team](https://deploy.equinix.com/get-started/).

**Quick Bullet Points of Toils Solved:**

- Moves `root` user to -> `adminuser`
    - Use of root for outside access is restricted, access outside in with user `adminuser`
    - `adminuser`'s password should be the same password as the root password assigned by Metal.
- [Management UI](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/managing_systems_using_the_rhel_9_web_console/index) ([Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/) via self-signed HTTPS over [Metal Internet](https://deploy.equinix.com/developers/docs/metal/networking/ip-addresses/#public-ipv4-subnet))
- VM hosting via [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/) (accesible in [Cockpit](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/managing_systems_using_the_rhel_9_web_console/managing-virtual-machines-in-the-web-console_system-management-using-the-rhel-9-web-console))
- Container hosting via [podman](https://podman.io/) (accesible in [Cockpit](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit-podman))
- Automatic Updates configured via [dnf-automatic](https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/automatic.html)
    - Security updates are automatically applied.
- Basic securitization (`root` -> `adminuser`, firewall up, user-lockout etc)
- Mounts largest non-HDD free disk to `/mnt/util/`
  - Adds it as storage volume to `libvirt`
  - Exposed via private network HTTP (via `nginx` below)
  - Exposed via private network NFS (via `nfs-server`)
- Network
    - Replaces stock Metal networking with `eth0/1` -> `bond0` -> `bridge` -> `VLAN` model allowing guests access to the native VLAN (carrying EM's [Layer-3 network](https://deploy.equinix.com/developers/docs/metal/networking/ip-addresses/)) + [tagged VLAN](https://deploy.equinix.com/developers/docs/metal/layer2-networking/overview/)s while persisting the desired [Equinix Metal LACP bonding](https://deploy.equinix.com/developers/docs/metal/networking/server-level-networking/#your-servers-lacp-bonding) configuration.
        - This allows the instance and it's guests to acces [Interconnection](https://deploy.equinix.com/developers/docs/metal/interconnections/introduction/)
    + NAT'ed Internet for `mgmt_a` network
    - DHCP for mgmt_a network via hostname ending in `-01`, for example `ncb-sv-01`
    - Inside VLAN Layer-3 configuration dynamic based on hostname, e.g a host launched as `ncb-am-55` will use `55` as it's inside IP for all networks (e.g `172.16.100.55`), a host launched with `ncb-am-33` would then be assigned `33` (e.g `172.16.100.33`), and they would be able to ping each other inside VLAN `3880` when assigned that VLAN from the Metal platform.
    - Forward DNS in management networks
    - Reverse DNS in management networks
        ```
        [adminuser@ncb-sv-04 ~]$ dig -x 172.16.101.5 @172.16.100.4

        - Note the generic `host-5.mgmtb.gtst.local.`
    - Automatic inclusion in [EM SA Network Schema networks](https://github.com/dlotterman/metal_code_snippets/tree/main/virtual_appliance_host/no_code_with_guardrails#em-sa-network-schema), simply apply VLANs from the Metal UI / CLI in [Hybrid Bonded](https://deploy.equinix.com/developers/docs/metal/layer2-networking/hybrid-bonded-mode/) mode
- HTTP endpoint via NGINX
    - Public Internet exposed HTTP endpoint (port `80` on Metal Instance's [Public IP](https://deploy.equinix.com/developers/docs/metal/networking/ip-addresses/#public-ipv4-subnet))
    - Private ([Backend Transfer](https://deploy.equinix.com/developers/docs/metal/networking/backend-transfer/) + VLAN only, port `81`) exposed HTTP endpoint (not open to internet)
- Forward HTTP proxy via NGINX
    - Allows servers on private networks to use `ncb` as a simple HTTP proxy on port 83
    - This allows for easy "no public internet" installs for things that can HTTP proxy on the private management network, like [Harvester](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.1/install/harvester-configuration/#example-9) or [OpenShift](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy.html).
- NFS / NAS via linux
    - Exposes largest non-HDD drive via NFS to private networks, including Metal's Backend Transfer network
- TFTP server via dnsmasq in `mgmt_a` network via hostname ending in `-01`, for example `ncb-sv-01`
    - Enables quick paths for `DHCP` + `PXE` + `TFTP` + `HTTP/NFS` BYO-OS install paths
- Should work with broadly with [Equinix Metal hardware](https://deploy.equinix.com/developers/docs/metal/hardware/standard-servers/) (including [4x port boxes](https://deploy.equinix.com/product/servers/n3-xlarge/) and the [s3.xlarge](https://deploy.equinix.com/product/servers/s3-xlarge/)

### Tools you will want

- A well setup SSH toolchain including a public key associated with your user in Equinix Metal
  - This includes the use of SSH based Interconnection
    - [SOCKS](https://github.com/dlotterman/metal_code_snippets/blob/main/documentation_stage/operator_documentation/bastion_socks_tunnel_guide.md#configuring-ssh-with-socks)
	- With a correctly configured SOCKs proxy, you can naviate *"inside"* or private resources like ESXi interfaces, storage interfaces, or Interconnection attached resources, easily from a single point. It is often easiest to "Dedicate a browser to the function", [Firefox Portable](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1286588) makes this easy and supports tunneled DNS.
    - [Local / Remote Port Forwading](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-setup-ssh-tunneling/)
      - This makes things like RDP'ing to a hosted VM simple and fast. No fiddling with VPN's, no dangerous exposed ports to the internet. Everything gets encrypted, everything stays private.
- A VNC client
  - The author promotes [TigerVNC](https://github.com/TigerVNC/tigervnc)
    - [VNC over SSH](https://sscf.ucsd.edu/self-help-guides/tutorials/linux/vnc-with-ssh-tunnel)

### Known incompatible hardware
- c2.medium.x86
  - Has problems provisioning alma_9
- t3.small.x86
  - Cannot provision alma_9
- m3.small.x86
  - Some m3.smalls are currently launched with Intel E810 NICs that have an incompatibility with their ToR that block some deployments
